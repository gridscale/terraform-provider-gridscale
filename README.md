## Development

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.24+ is *required*). You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

    $ make build

To test the provider, simply run

    $ make test

To run the full suite of acceptance tests execute `make testacc` you will need to set `GRIDSCALE_UUID`, `GRIDSCALE_TOKEN`, and `GRIDSCALE_URL` environment variables to point to an existing project when running acceptance tests.

*Note:* acceptance tests create real resources and often cost money to run.

    $ make testacc

To run a specific acceptance test, use `TESTARGS`.

    $ make testacc \
        TEST=./gridscale \
        TESTARGS='-run=TestAccResourceGridscaleLoadBalancerBasic'

# Override local terraform provider for development

Create `local-dev.tfrc` with this content and change YOUR_USERNAME:

```
provider_installation {
  # Use /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/github/terraform-provider-gridscale as an overridden package directory
  # for the hashicorp/null provider. This disables the version and checksum
  # verifications for this provider and forces Terraform to look for the
  # null provider plugin in the given directory.
  dev_overrides {
    "gridscale/gridscale" = "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/github/terraform-provider-gridscale/"
  }
  # For all other providers, install them directly from their origin provider
  # registries as normal. If you omit this, Terraform will _only_ use
  # the dev_overrides block, and so no other providers will be available.
  direct {}
}
```

`export TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE=./local-dev.tfrc`

Build the binary: `go build -o terraform-provider-gridscale`

Now you can run `terraform plan/apply` and terraform will tell you that you are using a local version of that provider:

```
> terraform apply
╷
│ Warning: Provider development overrides are in effect
│
│ The following provider development overrides are set in the CLI configuration:
│  - gridscale/gridscale in /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/github/terraform-provider-gridscale
│
│ The behavior may therefore not match any released version of the provider and applying changes may cause the state to become incompatible with published
│ releases.
╵
```

## Releasing the Provider

A [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) configuration is provided that produces build artifacts matching the [layout required](https://www.terraform.io/docs/registry/providers/publishing.html#manually-preparing-a-release) to publish the provider in the Terraform Registry.

Releases will appear as drafts. Once marked as published on the GitHub Releases page, they will become available via the Terraform Registry. Releases are signed with key ID (long) `4841EC2F6BC7BD4515F60C10047EC899C2DC3656`.

Jump to the [Release Checklist](release-checklist.md) for details.

## Known Issues

The following issues are known to us:

- Changing the name attribute in a template datasource will not trigger storages using this template to be recreated.
- If a storage has snapshots, Terraform cannot delete it.
- The autorecovery value of a server can't be changed with Terraform.
- Fail when update k8s resource when upgrading from terraform provider gridscale v2.0.2 to v2.0.3. In order to solve this issue, you will need to change the one of nodepool's `cores`, `memory`, `storage`, or `storage_type` value in the k8s resource, and then apply the changes via `terraform apply`. After that, you need to change it back to the original value and `terraform apply` again. This will fix the inconsistency between the provider and the gridscale API.
