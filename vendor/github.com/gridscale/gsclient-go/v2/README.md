# The gridscale Go Client
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/gridscale/gsclient-go.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/gridscale/gsclient-go) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/gridscale/gsclient-go)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/gridscale/gsclient-go)

This is a client for the gridscale API. It can be used to make an application interact with the gridscale cloud platform to create and manage resources.

## Preparation for Use

To be able to use this client a number of steps need to be taken. First a gridscale account will be required, which can be created [here](https://my.gridscale.io/signup/). Then an API-token [should be created](https://my.gridscale.io/APIs/).

## Installation

First the Go programming language will need to be installed. This can be done by using [the official Go installation guide](https://golang.org/doc/install) or by using the packages provided by your distribution.
 
Downloading the gridscale Go client can be done with the following go command:

```
go get "github.com/gridscale/gsclient-go"
```

## Using the gridscale Client

To be able to use the gridscale Go client in an application it can be imported in a go file. This can be done with the following code:

```go
import (
	"github.com/gridscale/gsclient-go"
)
```

To get access to the functions of the Go client, a Client type needs to be created. This requires a Config type. Both of these can be created with the following code: 

```go
//Using default config
config := gsclient.DefaultConfiguration("User-UUID", "API-token")

//OR Custom config
config := gsclient.NewConfiguration(
            "API-URL", 
            "User-UUID", 
            "API-token"), 
            false, //Set debug mode
            true, //Set sync mode 
            120, //Timeout (in seconds) of checking requests
            500, //Delay (in milliseconds) between requests
            100, //Maximum number of retries
        )
client := gsclient.NewClient(config)
```

Make sure to replace the user-UUID and API-token strings with valid credentials or variables containing valid credentials. It is recommended to use environment variables for them.

## Using API endpoints

***Note: `context` has to be passed to all APIs of `gsclient-go` as the first parameter. 

After having created a Client type, as shown above, it will be possible to interact with the API. An example would be the [Servers Get endpoint](https://gridscale.io/en/api-documentation/index.html#servers-get):

```go
cxt := context.Background()
servers := client.GetServerList(ctx)
```

For creating and updating/patching objects in gridscale, it will be required to use the respective CreateRequest and UpdateRequest types. For creating an SSH-key that would be SshkeyCreateRequest and SshkeyUpdateRequest. Here an example:

```go
cxt := context.Background()
requestBody := gsclient.IPCreateRequest {
	Family: gsclient.IPv6Type,
	Name:   "IPTest",
}

client.CreateIP(ctx, requestBody)
```

What options are available for each create and update request can be found in the source code. After installing it should be located in: 
```
~/go/src/github.com/gridscale/gsclient-go
```
