# gridscale_storage_import

Create a new storage via a storage backup. This can be used to create, modify, and delete the imported storages.

## Example Usage

The following example shows how to clone a storage instance in gridscale:

```terraform
resource "gridscale_storage_import" "foo" {
  storage_backup_id   = "xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx"
  name = "imported storage"
  storage_type = "storage_high"
  capacity = 20
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `storage_backup_id` - (Required) ID of the storage backup that will be used to create a new storage from.

* `name` - (Required) The human-readable name of the object. It supports the full UTF-8 character set, with a maximum of 64 characters.

* `capacity` - (Optional) The default value is inherited from the source storage instance. A desired capacity is possible. Required (integer - minimum: 1 - maximum: 4096).

* `storage_type` - (Optional) The default value is inherited from the source storage instance. A desired storage type is possible. (one of storage, storage_high, storage_insane).

* `labels` - (Optional) List of labels in the format [ "label1", "label2" ].
