# gridscale_server

Provides a server resource. This can be used to create, modify and delete servers.

## Example

The following example shows how one might use this resource to add a server to gridscale:

```terraform
resource "gridscale_server" "terra-server-test"{
	name = "terra-server-test"
	cores = 2
	memory = 1
	storage {
		object_uuid = gridscale_storage.terra-storage-test.id
	}
	storage {
    		object_uuid = "UUID of storage 2",
    	}
	network {
		object_uuid = gridscale_network.terra-network-test.id
		bootdevice = true
	}
	network {
    		object_uuid = "UUID of network 2"
    }
	ipv4 = gridscale_ipv4.terra-ipv4-test.id}
	ipv6 = "UUID of ipv6 address"
	isoimage = "9be3e0a3-42ac-4207-8887-3383c405724d"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:
