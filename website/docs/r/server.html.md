# gridscale_server

Provides a server resource. This can be used to create, modify, and delete servers.

## Example

The following example shows how one might use this resource to add a server to gridscale:

```terraform
resource "gridscale_server" "terra-server-test" {
  name = "terra-server-test"
  cores = 2
  memory = 1
  storage {
    object_uuid = gridscale_storage.terra-storage-test.id
  }
  network {
    object_uuid = gridscale_network.terra-network-test.id
    bootdevice = true
  }
  network {
    object_uuid = gridscale_network.terra-network-test-2.id
  }
  ipv4 = gridscale_ipv4.terra-ipv4-test.id
  isoimage = "9be3e0a3-42ac-4207-8887-3383c405724d"
  timeouts {
      create="10m"
  }
}
```

**NOTE: If no firewall rules are set, the firewall is inactive. Only if at least one firewall rule is set the firewall is active.
Packets that do not match any rule are blocked. E.g:

```terraform
resource "gridscale_server" "terra-server-test" {
  name = "terra-server-test"
  cores = 2
  memory = 1
  storage {
    object_uuid = gridscale_storage.terra-storage-test.id
  }
  network {
    object_uuid = gridscale_network.terra-network-test.id
    rules_v4_in {
        order = 0
        protocol = "tcp"
        action = "accept"
        dst_port = "22"
        comment = "ssh"
    }
    rules_v6_in	{
        order = 1
        protocol = "tcp"
        action = "accept"
        dst_port = "22"
        comment = "ssh"
    }
  }
  network {
    object_uuid = gridscale_network.terra-network-test-2.id
  }
  ipv4 = gridscale_ipv4.terra-ipv4-test.id
  isoimage = "9be3e0a3-42ac-4207-8887-3383c405724d"
  timeouts {
      create="10m"
  }
}
```
In this case, the inbound packets that do not match 2 rules above will be blocked.

If enabled, hot-plugging cores, memory, storage, network, etc. will not work, but the server will most likely run every x86 compatible operating system. This mode comes with a performance penalty, as emulated hardware does not benefit from the virtio driver infrastructure.
* `status` - Status indicates the status of the object.
* `usage_in_minutes_memory` - Total minutes of memory used.
* `usage_in_minutes_cores` - Total minutes of cores used.
