# gridscale_firewall

Provides a firewall resource. This can be used to create, modify and delete firewalls.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gridscale_firewall" "foo" {
  name   = "newname"
  rules_v4_in {
	order = 0
	protocol = "tcp"
	action = "drop"
	dst_port = "20:80"
	comment = "test"
  }
  rules_v6_in {
	order = 0
	protocol = "tcp"
	action = "drop"
	dst_port = "2000:3000"
	comment = "testv6"
  }
}
```
