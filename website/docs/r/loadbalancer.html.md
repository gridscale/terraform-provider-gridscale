# gridscale_loadbalancer

Provides a loadbalancer resource. This can be used to create, modify and delete loadbalancers.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gridscale_loadbalancer" "foo" {
  	project = "default"
	name   = "%s"
	algorithm = "%s"
	redirect_http_to_https = false
	listen_ipv4_uuid = gridscale_ipv4.lb.id
	listen_ipv6_uuid = gridscale_ipv6.lb.id
	labels = []
	backend_server {
		weight = 100
		host   = gridscale_ipv4.server.ip
	}
	forwarding_rule {
		listen_port =  80
		mode        =  "http"
		target_port =  80
	}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `project` - (Required) The name of project which is set in GRIDSCALE_PROJECTS_TOKENS env variable.

* `name` - (Required) The human-readable name of the object. It supports the full UTF-8 charset, with a maximum of 64 characters.

* `redirect_http_to_https` - (Required) Whether the loadbalancer is forced to redirect requests from HTTP to HTTPS.
