# gridscale_loadbalancer

Provides a loadbalancer resource. This can be used to create, modify, and delete load balancers.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gridscale_loadbalancer" "foo" {
  name   = "test-lb"
  algorithm = "leastconn"
  redirect_http_to_https = false
  listen_ipv4_uuid = gridscale_ipv4.lb.id
  listen_ipv6_uuid = gridscale_ipv6.lb.id
  labels = []
  backend_server {
    weight = 100
    host   = gridscale_ipv4.server.ip
  }
  forwarding_rule {
    listen_port =  80
    mode        =  "http"
    target_port =  80
  }
  timeouts {
      create="10m"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The human-readable name of the object. It supports the full UTF-8 character set, with a maximum of 64 characters.

* `redirect_http_to_https` - (Required) Whether the load balancer is forced to redirect requests from HTTP to HTTPS.

* `listen_ipv4_uuid` - (Required) The UUID of the IPv4 address the load balancer will listen to for incoming requests.

* `listen_ipv6_uuid` - (Required) The UUID of the IPv6 address the load balancer will listen to for incoming requests.

* `algorithm` - (Required) The algorithm used to process requests. Accepted values: roundrobin/leastconn.

* `forwarding_rule` - (Required) The forwarding rules of the load balancer.

  *  `letsencrypt_ssl` - (Optional) A valid domain name that points to the loadbalancer's IP address.

  *  `certificate_uuid` - (Optional) The UUID of a custom certificate.

  *  `listen_port` - (Required) Specifies the entry port of the load balancer.

  *  `target_port` - (Required) Specifies the exit port that the load balancer uses to forward the traffic to the backend server.

  *  `mode` - (Required) Supports HTTP and TCP mode. Valid values: http, tcp.

* `labels` - (Optional) List of labels in the format [ "label1", "label2" ].

## Timeouts

Timeouts configuration options (in seconds):
More info: [terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#operation-timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#operation-timeouts)

* `create` - (Default value is "5m" - 5 minutes) Used for creating a resource.
* `update` - (Default value is "5m" - 5 minutes) Used for updating a resource.
* `delete` - (Default value is "5m" - 5 minutes) Used for deleting a resource.

## Attributes

This resource exports the following attributes:

* `id` - The UUID of the load balancer.
* `location_uuid` - Helps to identify which datacenter an object belongs to. The location of the resource depends on the location of the project.
* `name` - The human-readable name of the load balancer.
* `algorithm` - The algorithm used to process requests.
* `status` - The status of the load balancer.
* `redirect_http_to_https` - Whether the Load balancer is forced to redirect requests from HTTP to HTTPS.
* `listen_ipv4_uuid` - The UUID of the IPv4 address the load balancer will listen to for incoming requests.
* `listen_ipv6_uuid` - The UUID of the IPv6 address the load balancer will listen to for incoming requests.
* `forwarding_rule` - See Argument Reference above.
  * `letsencrypt_ssl` - See Argument Reference above.
  * `certificate_uuid` - See Argument Reference above.
  * `listen_port` - See Argument Reference above.
  * `target_port` - See Argument Reference above.
  * `mode` - See Argument Reference above.
* `backend_server` - The servers that the load balancer can communicate with.
* `labels` - The list of labels.
