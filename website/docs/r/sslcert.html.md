# gridscale_ssl_certificate

Provides a TLS/SSL certificate resource. This can be used to create and delete TLS/SSL certificates.
A TLS/SSL certificate can be attached to a loadbalancer.

## Example Usage

The following example shows how one might use this resource to add an SSL Certificate to gridscale:

```terraform
resource "gridscale_ssl_certificate" "ssl-certificate-john"{
  name = "john's computer"
  private_key = "a private-key of the SSL certificate" //or file("/path/to/private.key")
  leaf_certificate = "a public SSL of the SSL certificate" //or file("/path/to/certificate.cert")
  timeouts {
    create="10m"
  }
}

resource "gridscale_loadbalancer" "lb-john" {
  name   = "john's lb"
  algorithm = "leastconn"
  redirect_http_to_https = false
  listen_ipv4_uuid = gridscale_ipv4.lb.id
  listen_ipv6_uuid = gridscale_ipv6.lb.id
  labels = []
  backend_server {
    weight = 100
    host   = gridscale_ipv4.server.ip
  }
  forwarding_rule {
    listen_port =  80
    mode        =  "http"
    target_port =  80
    certificate_uuid = gridscale_ssl_certificate.ssl-certificate-john.id
  }
  timeouts {
      create="10m"
  }
}
```

* `name` - (Required, Force New) The human-readable name of the object. It supports the full UTF-8 character set, with a maximum of 64 characters.

* `private_key` - (Required, Force New) The PEM-formatted private-key of the SSL certificate.

* `leaf_certificate` - (Required, Force New) The PEM-formatted public SSL of the SSL certificate.

* `certificate_chain` - (Optional, Force New) The PEM-formatted full-chain between the certificate authority and the domain's SSL certificate.

* `labels` - (Optional, Force New) List of labels in the format [ "label1", "label2" ].

## Timeouts

Timeouts configuration options (in seconds):
More info: [terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#operation-timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#operation-timeouts)

* `create` - (Default value is "5m" - 5 minutes) Used for creating a resource.
* `update` - (Default value is "5m" - 5 minutes) Used for updating a resource.
* `delete` - (Default value is "5m" - 5 minutes) Used for deleting a resource.
