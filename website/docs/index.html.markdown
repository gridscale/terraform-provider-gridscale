# gridscale Provider

The gridscale provider is used to interact with many resources supported by gridscale. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available data sources and resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform

# Declare required provider
terraform {
  required_providers {
    gridscale = {
      source = "gridscale/gridscale"
      version = "1.6.4"
    }
  }
}


# Configure the gridscale provider
provider "gridscale" {
	uuid = var.gridscale_uuid
	token = var.gridscale_token
  
}

# Create a server
resource "gridscale_server" "servername"{
  # ...
}
```

Also make sure to check out our other Terraform examples over at [github.com/gridscale/terraform_examples](https://github.com/gridscale/terraform_examples).

~> **Note** To verify that you are using the official released version of gridscale terraform provider, you just need to check the format of the `source` whether it is `<NAMESPACE>/<NAME>/<PROVIDER>`. For more information, visit https://registry.terraform.io/providers/gridscale/gridscale/latest

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `source` - (Required) The global source address for the provider you intend to use. In this case, we use `gridscale/gridscale`
* `version` - (Optional) A version constraint specifying which subset of available provider versions the module is compatible with.

* `uuid` - (Required) This is the User-UUID for the gridscale API. It can be found [in the panel](https://my.gridscale.io/APIs/). If omitted, the GRIDSCALE_UUID environment variable is used.
* `token` - (Required) This is an API-Token for the gridscale API. It can be created [in the panel](https://my.gridscale.io/APIs/). The created token needs to have full access to be usable by Terraform. If omitted, the GRIDSCALE_TOKEN environment variable is used.
* `api_url` - (Optional) The URL for the API. By default this is set to "https://api.gridscale.io". Do not add a "/" character at the end.
* `http_headers` - (Optional) Custom HTTP headers sent to gridscale server. If omitted, the GRIDSCALE_TF_HEADERS environment variable is used.
