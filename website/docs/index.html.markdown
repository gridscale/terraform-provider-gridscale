# gridscale Provider

The gridscale provider is used to interact with many resources supported by gridscale. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available data sources and resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configure the gridscale provider
provider "gridscale" {
	uuid = var.gridscale_uuid
	token = var.gridscale_token

}

# Create a server
resource "gridscale_server" "servername"{
  # ...
}
```
